\brief     Declares the MeshFilterComponent class, which stores
           information about which mesh asset an entity should use
           for rendering.

           This component holds the reference (GUID or path) to
           the mesh resource assigned to an entity. It acts as a
           link between the ECS entity and the mesh data used by
           rendering systems.

           Typically paired with MeshRendererComponent for defining
           how the mesh should appear visually.
