\brief		Defines the BoxColliderComponent class, representing a 
            box-shaped collision volume used for physical interactions 
            or trigger detection within the ECS framework.

            This component holds shape data (size, position) and a 
            trigger flag to determine whether it participates in 
            physics simulation or acts purely as an event trigger.

            The PhysX shape pointer is stored as a void* for engine-
            level binding and managed by the PhysicsManager.
